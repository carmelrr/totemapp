## 🎯 Navigation Structure Verification

### ✅ Active Screens in Navigation
**Main App Navigation (src/App.tsx):**
- HomeScreen
- ProfileScreen, UserProfileScreen  
- RoutesMapScreen, AddRouteMapScreen
- ColorPickerScreen, LeaderboardScreen, AnalyticsScreen
- SprayWall (SprayNavigator)

**SprayNavigator (src/navigation/SprayNavigator.tsx):**
- SprayWallHomeScreen, SprayResetScreen
- SprayEditorScreen, SprayLeaderboardScreen

### ✅ Current AddRoute Implementation
- **Active**: `src/features/routes-map/screens/AddRouteMapScreen.tsx`
- **Active**: `src/features/routes-map/screens/AddRouteScreen.tsx`
- **Removed**: Enhanced/New versions (as intended)

## 🚀 Benefits Achieved

### 1. **Cleaner Root Directory**
- Removed 5 development/debug scripts from root
- Only production-relevant files remain at top level
- Easier navigation for new developers

### 2. **Reduced Confusion**
- No more obsolete screen files
- Clear separation between active and archived code
- Removed backup files that could cause confusion

### 3. **Better Organization**
- Development tools properly archived with documentation
- Historical preservation without cluttering active codebase
- Clear archive structure for future reference

### 4. **Improved Developer Experience**
- Faster file searches and navigation
- Cleaner IDE project view
- Focus only on maintained, active code

### 5. **Production Readiness**
- No test/debug scripts in production bundle
- Reduced unnecessary file scanning
- Cleaner deployment package

## 📋 Maintenance Recommendations

### Going Forward:
1. **Archive immediately** - Move any new debug/test scripts to `archive/dev-tools/`
2. **Document archives** - Update README.md when adding new archived files
3. **Regular cleanup** - Quarterly review for new obsolete files
4. **Backup policy** - Move .backup files to archive instead of keeping in src/
5. **Branch cleanup** - Remove feature branches that have been merged and are no longer needed

## ✅ Status: CLEANUP COMPLETE

The codebase is now clean, organized, and production-ready with proper archival of development tools and removal of obsolete files. All navigation routes point to active, maintained screens, and no legacy cruft remains in the active codebase.
